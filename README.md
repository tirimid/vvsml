# vvsml
## Introduction
Very Very Simple Markup Language. VVSML is a simplified HTML, basically gutted
and with all the unnecessary features taken out (whether a feature is
unnecessary is decided at my discretion, as I am the only real user of VVSML).
There are also some features added. Mainly, however, VVSML was just created
because I like how portable HTML pages are, but absolutely despise actually
writing HTML.

## Design goals
The following are design goals, guidelines to strive for:
* Being fun to work on as a project
* Being written with high(ish) quality code
* Being applicable to my personal usage
* Being fast and easy to use

## NOT design goals
The following are NOT important to the project, I will not bother chasing them:
* Being usable on platforms other than Linux (would be nice, but not important)
* Having extensive documentation

## Contribution guidelines
Do not contribute unless you are me. Feel free to fork and create your own
version of VVSML, but you will likely have no use for it and will not share the
same requirements. I will only accept pull requests from myself.
